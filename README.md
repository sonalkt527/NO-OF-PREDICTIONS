# NO-OF-PREDICTIONS
A DATA SCIENCE PROJECT WHICH PREDICTS THE NUMBER OF REVIEWS WE WILL GET IN A PARTICULAR YEAR
WE START WITH LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL AND THEN COMPARE IT WITH POLNOMIAL MODEL ON THE BASIS OF R_VALUE AND P VALUE
THEN ACCORDING TO THE BEST SUITED MODEL WE SETTLE WITH POLYNOMIAL MODEL AND PREDICT THE NO OF REVIEWS WE WILL GET IN THE GIVEN YEAR
